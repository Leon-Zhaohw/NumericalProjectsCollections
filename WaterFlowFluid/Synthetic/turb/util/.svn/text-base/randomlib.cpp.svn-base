   This Random Number Generator is based on the algorithm in a FORTRAN
   version published by George Marsaglia and Arif Zaman, Florida State
   University; ref.: see original comments below.
   At the fhw (Fachhochschule Wiesbaden, W.Germany), Dept. of Computer
   Science, we have written sources in further languages (C, Modula-2
   Turbo-Pascal(3.0, 5.0), Basic and Ada) to get exactly the same test
   results compared with the original FORTRAN version.
   April 1989
   Karl-L. Noell <NOELL@DWIFH1.BITNET>
      and  Helmut  Weber <WEBER@DWIFH1.BITNET>

   This random number generator originally appeared in "Toward a Universal
   Random Number Generator" by George Marsaglia and Arif Zaman.
   Florida State University Report: FSU-SCRI-87-50 (1987)
   It was later modified by F. James and published in "A Review of Pseudo-
   random Number Generators"
   THIS IS THE BEST KNOWN RANDOM NUMBER GENERATOR AVAILABLE.
   (However, a newly discovered technique can yield
   a period of 10^600. But that is still in the development stage.)
   It passes ALL of the tests for random number generators and has a period
   of 2^144, is completely portable (gives bit identical results on all
   machines with at least 24-bit mantissas in the floating point
   representation).
   The algorithm is a combination of a Fibonacci sequence (with lags of 97
   and 33, and operation "subtraction plus one, modulo one") and an
   "arithmetic sequence" (using subtraction).

   Use IJ = 1802 & KL = 9373 to test the random number generator. The
   subroutine RANMAR should be used to generate 20000 random numbers.
   Then display the next six random numbers generated multiplied by 4096*4096
   If the random number generator is working properly, the random numbers
   should be:
           6533892.0  14220222.0  7275067.0
           6172232.0  8354498.0   10633180.0
